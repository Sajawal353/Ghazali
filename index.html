  <h3>Some Poetry Written For Ghazali</h3>
  <pre>
  In the heart of learning's fervent thrall,
  Stands Ghazali, proud and tall.
  A beacon of knowledge, shining bright,
  Guiding young minds to reach new height.
    
  Within its walls, wisdom takes flight,
  On wings of curiosity, pure and light.
  Each lesson a seed, in fertile minds sown,
  In Ghazali's gardens, future leaders are grown.
  
  The echo of laughter, the pursuit of dreams,
  The hallowed halls where thoughtfulness teems.
  Ghazali, a universe in a school's guise,
  Where every question leads to a prize.
  
  So here's to Ghazali, may it forever be,
  A cradle of potential, as vast as the sea.
  Where every student can rise and say,
  "I am the architect of my own way."
  Ghazali, where aspirations soar,
  A place where dreams unlock every door.
  In its embrace, the young and wise,
  Learn to challenge, innovate, and rise.
  
  A tapestry of cultures, rich and diverse,
  Ghazali's spirit, in verse, we converse.
  A symphony of ideas, in harmony blend,
  In the quest for knowledge, without end.
  
  Here, the past and future intertwine,
  Ghazali stands timeless, almost divine.
  Nurturing souls with gentle might,
  Turning darkness into radiant light.
  
  So let's celebrate this noble quest,
  In Ghazali's halls, we are truly blessed.
  For it's more than a school, it's a brighter dawn,
  Where the legacy of enlightenment is drawn.
